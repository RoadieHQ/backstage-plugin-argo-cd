## How to add argo-cd project dependency to Backstage app

If you have your own backstage application without this plugin, here it's how to add it:

1. In the `backstage/packages/app` project add the plugin as a `package.json` dependency:

```bash
yarn add @roadiehq/backstage-plugin-argo-cd
```

2. In the `app-config.yaml` file in the root directory, add argo-cd to the proxy object and optionally add the base url for your argoCD web UI:

```yml
proxy:
  ...

  '/argocd/api':
    # url to the api of your hosted argoCD instance
    target: https://159.65.209.132/api/v1/
    changeOrigin: true
    # this line is required if your hosted argoCD instance has self-signed certificate
    secure: false
    headers:
      Cookie:
        $env: ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN


# optional: this will link to your argoCD web UI for each argoCD application
argocd:
  baseUrl: https://my-argocd-web-ui.com
```

3. Add plugin to the list of plugins:

```ts
// packages/app/src/plugins.ts
export { argocdPlugin } from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-argo-cd';
```

4. Add plugin to the `entityPage.tsx` source file:

```ts
// packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx
import {
  EntityArgoCDOverviewCard,
  isArgocdAvailable
} from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-argo-cd';

const overviewContent = (
  <Grid container spacing={3} alignItems="stretch">
    ...
    <EntitySwitch>
      <EntitySwitch.Case if={e => Boolean(isArgocdAvailable(e))}>
        <Grid item sm={4}>
          <EntityArgoCDOverviewCard />
        </Grid> 
      </EntitySwitch.Case> 
    </EntitySwitch>
    ...
  </Grid>
);
```

## How to use Argo-cd plugin in Backstage

The Argo CD plugin is a part of the Backstage sample app. To start using it for your component, you have to:

1. Add an annotation to the YAML config file of a component. If there is only a single Argo CD application for the component, you can use
    ```yml
    argocd/app-name: <app-name>
    ```
    You can also use labels to select multiple Argo CD applications for a component:
    ```yml
    argocd/app-selector: <app-selector>
    ```
    **Note:** You can only use one of the options per component.

1. Add your auth key to the environmental variables for your backstage backend server (you can acquire it by sending a GET HTTP request to Argo CD's `/session` endpoint with username and password):
    ```
    ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN="argocd.token=<auth-token>"
    ```
## Support for multiple ArgoCD instances

If you want to create multiple components that fetch data from different argoCD instances, you have to add a proxy config for each instance:

```yml
proxy:
  ...

  '/argocd/api':
    target: https://<someAddress>/api/v1/
    changeOrigin: true
    secure: false
    headers:
      Cookie:
        $env: ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN

  '/argocd/api2':
    target: https://<otherAddress>/api/v1/
    changeOrigin: true
    secure: false
    headers:
      Cookie:
        $env: ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN2
```
Add all required auth tokens to environmental variables, in this example, `ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN2`.

And then in the following component definition annotations add a line with the url to the desired proxy path:
```yml
argocd/proxy-url: '/argocd/api2'
```
`argocd/proxy-url` annotation defaults to '/argocd/api' so it's not needed if there is only one proxy config.

## Develop plugin locally

You can clone the plugin repo into the `plugins/` directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-plugin-argo-cd.git argo-cd
```

and run `yarn` in the root backstage directory - it will create a symbolic link so the dependency will be provided from the source code instead of node_modules package.
