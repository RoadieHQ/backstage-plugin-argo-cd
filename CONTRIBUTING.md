# Contributing to the Backstage Argo CD plugin

We want the Backstage Argo CD plugin to become the best possible Argo CD plugin for Backstage. This is an ambitious goal, and we can't do it without the support of the community.

Therefore we want to create strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that Backstage deserves.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ‚ù§Ô∏è

The Backstage Argo CD plugin is released under the Apache 2.0 License, and original creations contributed to this repo are accepted under the same license.

We aim to stick as closely as possible to the [contribution guidelines which apply to the Backstage project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If something is not covered in this document, please assume that the appropriate Backstage guideline will apply. 

## Types of Contributions

### Report bugs

No one likes bugs. Report bugs as an issue [here](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-plugin-argo-cd/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_template.md).

### Fix bugs or build new features

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs or problems that other users are having. If you're having a problem yourself, feel free to contribute a fix for us to review.

### Submit feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file [an issue](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-plugin-argo-cd/issues/new).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Explain the wider context about what you are trying to achieve.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

### Add your company to ADOPTERS

## Coding Guidelines

We use the backstage-cli to build, serve, lint, test and package this plugin, just like the plugins which live within the Backstage monorepo in the `/plugins` directory. 

Also, the `tsconfig.json` simply extends the upstream `@backstage/cli/config/tsconfig.json`.

As such, the [same coding guidelines modly apply](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-guidelines).

## Merging to main

Plugins are automatically published when a version bump is merged to the `main` branch. Please include version bumps with your pull requests if you would like them to be released.
